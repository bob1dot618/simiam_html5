You need to run a webserver to use this program. There is a simple
python web server in this directory, that you can use. Then, point
your browser at localhost:8000, and select 'samiam.html'.

If you feel like changing the controller algorithms, look at robot.js.
The object method named 'controller' defines the movement and redraw
of the robot. If you change that around, you can see the effects by
using 'ctrl-F5' to reload the javascript.
